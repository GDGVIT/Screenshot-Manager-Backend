## Description
When we are analyzing a webpage on our devices or phones, we may find out faults in the webpage which we will send to the developer by circling on the mistake. The application will classify the entire screenshot into different HTML components, it will divide the screenshot into header, paragraph, buttons and images without converting into HTML code just with the help of image processing and label it. For example if a screenshot has 3 paragraphs then it will label them as paragraph 1,2,3 and the header as header1 etc.In this way we will be able to give the developers targeted comment on what is wrong in the webpage.
